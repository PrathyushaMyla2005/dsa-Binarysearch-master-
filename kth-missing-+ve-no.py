'''Kth Missing Positive Number
Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array of positive integers (strictly increasing) and an integer k.
Your task is to find the kth missing positive number.

Step 1: Understand the Problem

The array is sorted and only contains some positive integers.

We want the k-th positive integer that is NOT present in the array.

Example 1:arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11]
k = 5
Missing numbers: [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...]
The 5th missing = 9

Output â†’ 9'''

    Brute Force Approach:
    ---------------------
    - Start from number 1 and keep counting missing numbers.
    - If a number is not in arr, reduce k by 1.
    - When k becomes 0, return that number.

    Optimized Approach:
    -------------------
    - Use Binary Search to find the smallest index where missing numbers >= k.
    - Formula: missing(i) = arr[i] - (i + 1)
      (because if no numbers missing until index i, arr[i] should be i+1).
    - After binary search, compute result.
