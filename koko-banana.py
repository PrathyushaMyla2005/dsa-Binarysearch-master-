Problem Statement (in simple words)
-----------------------------------
- We have piles of bananas.
- Koko eats at a speed "k" bananas per hour.
- She can only eat from one pile per hour.
- If pile < k, she just finishes it and the rest of the hour is wasted.
- We must find the *minimum speed k* so that she finishes all piles in h hours.

    Brute Force Approach
    --------------------
    - Try all speeds from 1 to max(piles).
    - For each speed, calculate total hours needed.
    - Return the first speed that allows finishing in <= h hours.
