'''Problem Statement (in simple words)

You are given a 2D matrix with these conditions:

Each row is sorted in ascending order.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
(So if you read the matrix row by row, it looks like one big sorted array).

Task: Check if a given target number exists in the matrix.
Return True if itâ€™s found, else False.

ðŸ”¹ Example
Matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 60]
]

Target = 3   â†’ Output: True
Target = 13  â†’ Output: False

    Brute Force Approach:
    ---------------------
    - Just check each element one by one.
    - If any element == target â†’ return True.
    - If after checking all elements, not found â†’ return False.

    Why this approach:
    - Simple and beginner-friendly.
    - Useful first step before optimization.

    Time Complexity (TC): O(m * n)   â†’ we may check all elements
    Space Complexity (SC): O(1)      â†’ no extra memory used

    Optimal Approach (Binary Search):
    ---------------------------------
    - Treat matrix as a sorted 1D array of size (m*n).
    - Use binary search on this virtual array.
    - Convert index back into (row, col):
        row = mid // n
        col = mid % n

    Why this approach:
    - Matrix is sorted like a 1D array â†’ binary search is best.
    - Much faster than brute force.

    Time Complexity (TC): O(log(m*n))   â†’ binary search
    Space Complexity (SC): O(1)         â†’ constant space
